## URL
For local development, set in `.env.development`:
```bash title=".env.development"
VITE_APP_URL="http://localhost:3377"
```

For production, set in `.env.production`:
```bash title=".env.production"
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Basic Information
VibeAny's basic application information is configured in the `src/config/site-config.ts` file.

```ts title="src/config/site-config.ts"
export const siteConfig = {
  title: "VibeAny",
  author: "Jayden & Lingjue",
  description: "VibeAny ",
  theme: {
    defaultTheme: "default", // Default theme, can be "light", "dark", or "system"
    enableSwitch: true, // Whether to show the theme toggle button
  },
  images: {
    ogImage: "/og.jpg", // Open Graph image, displayed when sharing to social media
    logo: "/logo.svg", // Website logo
    isInvert: true, // Whether to invert colors, set to true when the logo needs color inversion in dark mode
  },
  social: {
    github: "https://github.com/jiahao-jayden/vibe-any",
    twitter: "https://x.com/VibeAny",
    discord: "https://discord.gg/yVwpEtTT",
    youtube: "https://www.youtube.com/@VibeAny",
  },
}
```

### Replace Logo
You can use online tools to generate a nice logo, such as:
- [Logo Maker](https://www.design.com/logo-maker)
- [Logo Fast](https://shipfa.st/tools/logo-fast)

1. Place your logo file in the `public/` directory
2. Update `siteConfig.images.logo` with the new path
3. If the logo needs color inversion in dark mode, set `isInvert: true`

Additionally, you need to set a favicon, which determines the icon displayed in the browser tab. You can use the following tool to convert it to a favicon and place it in the `public/` directory as `favicon.ico`:

- [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-ico)

### Replace OG Image

The Open Graph image is displayed when sharing on social media.

You can reference others' Open Graph images for design inspiration, or use online tools to generate one:
- [Ricoog](https://ricoog.com/)
- [Og Image Generator via code](https://og-playground.vercel.app/)
- [Og Image Generator via UI](https://ogimage.click/)


1. Prepare an image
2. Place it in the `public/` directory
3. Update the `siteConfig.images.ogImage` path

Locally, you can use TanStack's Devtools to quickly preview how the Open Graph Image looks across different platforms.

## SiteMap
A sitemap is an important way for search engines to index your website. It tells search engines about the site's structure and content, helping them better understand your website.

You don't need to configure the sitemap manually — VibeAny automatically generates it. This is a built-in capability of TanStack Start. See the [TanStack Start documentation](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/seo#sitemaps) for more.

## Robots.txt
Robots.txt tells search engines which pages can be crawled and which cannot.

VibeAny's robots.txt configuration is centralized in the `src/config/robots-config.ts` file. VibeAny automatically generates the robots.txt file.
```ts title="src/config/robots-config.ts"
export const robotsConfig = {
  rules: {
    userAgent: "*",
    allow: "/",
    disallow: ["/*?*q=", "/admin/*", "/api/*"],
  },
  sitemap: `${import.meta.env.VITE_APP_URL}/sitemap.xml`,
}
```
