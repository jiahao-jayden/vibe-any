# Changelog

A simple, reliable release notes system based on MDX. Files live in `content/changelog/`, are parsed by content-collections, and are routed under `/changelog/*` (＾▽＾)

<Callout type="info">
Localization is supported. Create paired files like `1-0-0.mdx` and `1-0-0.zh.mdx`. The locale is detected from the filename.
</Callout>

## File Structure (・ω・)

- Directory: `content/changelog/`
- Filename: `{version}.mdx` (e.g., `1-0-0.mdx`), localized variant `{version}.zh.mdx`
- Route prefix: `/changelog` (generated by content-collections)

## Frontmatter Schema (￣▽￣)

From `content-collections.ts` — collection `changelog`:

- `title: string` (required)
- `description: string` (required)
- `date: string` (ISO datetime, required)
- `version: string` (optional, e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- `tags: string[]` (optional)
- `published: boolean` (default: `true`)

Example:

```mdx
---
title: "Initial Release"
description: "First release with i18n, auth, payments, and MDX"
date: "2025-08-31T00:00:00Z"
version: "v1.0.0"
published: true
---

### Highlights

- Internationalization (en/zh)
- Auth with Better Auth (GitHub/Google OAuth)
- Stripe payments with webhook at `/api/payment/webhook`
```

## Authoring Guide (｀・ω・´)

1. Create a new MDX file: `content/changelog/{version}.mdx` and optional `{version}.zh.mdx`.
2. Fill in frontmatter using an ISO date (e.g., `2025-01-01T00:00:00Z`).
3. Write sections like `### Highlights`, `### Changes`, `### Fixes` as needed.
4. Set `published: true` when ready to show.
5. Commit and deploy. Routes are available under `/changelog/{version}`.

## Localization Notes (・∀・)

- Locale is inferred from filename suffix like `.zh.mdx`.
- When a locale variant does not exist, only the default locale file is used.

## FAQ

**Q: My release isn’t visible.**  
**A:** Check `published: true`, ensure `date` is a valid ISO string, and verify the filename (e.g., `1-2-3.mdx`). Also confirm your current site locale has a corresponding file if you expect a localized page.

**Q: How should I order entries?**  
**A:** Use the `date` field to represent the release date. Consumers typically sort by `date` descending.

**Q: Can I add tags?**  
**A:** Yes, add a `tags: []` array in frontmatter for filtering or labeling in your UI.
