description: Learn how to deploy your project to the Vercel platform
---

A complete, beginner‑friendly guide to deploying this project on Vercel. The app uses Next.js (App Router), and Vercel offers first‑class support and optimizations for it.

## Prerequisites

1. Source code hosted on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. A Vercel account (signed in)
3. Production environment variables prepared (DB & third‑party services)

## Quick Start (Recommended)

<div className="fd-steps">
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### Push code
    Push your `main` branch to the remote repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
  </div>
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### Connect to Vercel
    Open Vercel → Add New Project → Import Git Repository, and select your repo.
  </div>
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### Initial configuration
    - **Framework Preset**: `Next.js`
    - **Build Command**: `bun run build` (or `npm run build` / `pnpm build`)
    - **Install Command**: `bun install` (or defaults)
    - **Output Directory**: `.next` (keep default)

    > Tip: Vercel usually auto‑detects these. When using Bun, explicitly set `bun run build` and `bun install` for consistency.
  </div>
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### Environment Variables
    - See the "[Environment Variables](../introduction/environment)" page for the full list and explanation.
    - In Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables, paste a whole `.env` block; Vercel will auto‑split it into multiple entries.

    ```bash
    # Paste example (copy the complete .env from your project that is already configured)
    # KEY=VALUE multi‑line text; paste as a whole block into Vercel
    ```
    
    ![](/docs/deploy/deploy-vercel-env.avif)

    > Important: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` must be the final user‑facing domain. If you use `*.vercel.app`, deploy once → copy the generated domain → set the env var → redeploy.
  </div>
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### Deploy
    Click Deploy and wait for the build to finish.
  </div>
</div>

## Glossary

- **Environment Variables**: runtime config, not stored in code. Variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser; do not put secrets there.
- **Preview Deployment**: temporary deployments for branches/PRs, used for testing.
- **Production Deployment**: the official release triggered from the main branch.
- **Redeploy**: trigger a new deployment so changed configs/envs take effect.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

Project Settings → Domains → Add → follow DNS instructions. Mark it as Primary when verified.

> Mainland China notice: the default `*.vercel.app` domain may be slow or inaccessible from mainland China. Consider binding your own domain and, if needed, using local DNS/CDN acceleration.

## Common operations

- Update env vars → Redeploy
- Roll back to any previous deployment from the Deployments list
- Use PR previews for acceptance testing without affecting production

## Troubleshooting (FAQ)

### Build Failures

- Check Build Logs for stack traces
- Ensure a consistent package manager (Bun/NPM/PNPM) and a lockfile
- Validate PostgreSQL connection string format (`postgres://user:pass@host:port/db`)
- Missing env vars? Cross‑check with the list above

### Runtime Issues

- Verify third‑party (GitHub/Google/Stripe) credentials and permissions
- Separate `NEXT_PUBLIC_` client vars from server‑only secrets
- Ensure database connectivity and run Drizzle migrations
- Inspect Server/Edge logs in Vercel → Logs
