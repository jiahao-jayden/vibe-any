description: Configure authentication related settings

Authentication configuration currently exposes a cookie prefix for auth-related cookies.

### File

`src/config/auth/auth-config.tsx`

```ts
export const COOKIE_PREFIX = "vibe-any"
```

Change `COOKIE_PREFIX` to avoid cookie collision when deploying multiple apps under the same domain.
